This is a fixed kgmacros based on Mountain Lion 10.8.3 kernel debug kit.
It's goal is to work with VMware kernel gdb stub. The default kgmacros file has
problems working with VMware.
Only tested with this stub, not over kdp. Probably works over kdp since fixes
are only missing casts. I doubt it will work with older versions, in particular
Lion and Snow Leopard due to changes in internal structures. With other
Mountain Lion versions your chances are better!

If you want to debug 64 bits kernels (Mountain Lion in particular), you should
use this fixed gdb version at https://github.com/gdbinit/gdb-ng.

For info about using VMware's gdb stub refer to Snare post:

It's still a work in progress, quite a few commands still need to be fixed.
THe most useful commands (to me at least) are already working.

Enjoy,
Pedro
